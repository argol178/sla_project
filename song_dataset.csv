0,Let Us Pray,...a Chosen Few,"Hail covens, this is it
A thousand amps toll the end time riff
The sky a coffin lid
All condemned beneath its shadow
The chosen few, the chosen knew
Spelled out in the stars his prophecy
Raise your fists; now you exist
The bell of doom strikes 13th hour

The time has come
All the chosen, time to put down your bongs
Take up a knife; end all life
Legalise drugs and murder
Satanas luciferus we pledge these souls to you
Now satan's slaves, your lives weren't saved
Die now in the shadow of the pentagram

The chosen few, look up in the sky
The chosen few, waiting for the sign
The chosen few, still children of the grave
Satan's slaves"
1,We Live,Another Perfect Day?,"Today I stopped and stared
I realised I just don't care
A chasm black and wide
Between me and mankind

I've walked this earth 1000 years
Seen the pain and the tears
An outcast all alone
Take me back beyond the sun...."
2,Dopethrone,Barbarian,"He left the northern hills to seek his fortune
A lone Barbarian with only death lust to guide
But he carved a kingdom of stone
King Conan, sitting on his bloody throne, no

His black mane sweeps across his face
Grim and silent with steely blue gaze
Like a panther ready to strike
His blade crashes down to end your life, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess, a true measure of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

Master swordsman of Hyborian Age
His name is a legend to this very day
Even gods cower when his sword is unleashed
Nothing dare face him, neither man or beast, no

Cut a bloody swathe across his battlefield
Red mist rising, break your human shield
Slashed to pieces is to be your fate
Unleash berserker rage no-one shall escape, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess the true nature of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You will never understand"

Day of judgment, it has arrived
All you sinners, you're gonna die
The Lord has shown you the way to live
Stop your hate, you've got to give

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Were you a slave
And told what to do
If that's so
He's come for you
Did you follow
Religion is a lie
Be not afraid
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
So change now, before it's too late
Or life in servitude will be your fate
Be free, do as you will
Love and happiness, you take your fill

[Hook]"
4,Electric Wizard,Black Butterfly,"Terror above, beautiful as the night
Black butterfly in full flight
Traveling through the void of space
To this long forgotten place

Druids gather at the circle of stones
To worship the ancient ones
In the glow of the dying red sun
Their rites of evil have only just begun

Evil monks fall to their knees
Black colossus, they must not see
Crystal shards drop from inside
Filling circles in their minds

Thirteen maidens awaiting sacrifice
Screaming, naked, they will slowly die
Blood has mingled with crystal drips ice
Open caverns of eternal midnight"

16,Electric Wizard,Electric Wizard,"One day we were sitting and wondering where it's at
When down came a dragon with a wizard on his back
He said to us, step up, wanna take you for a trip
Then up we flew off into space and the astral gates we slipped
Alright

Looking back behind us, to the freaks and heads we wave
And off beyond our system out until they're deep in space
And on the edge of time and space there stood two towers black
But on we flew, the wizard knew there was no turning back
Cast your spell on me

Higher and higher, through the cosmos we had tripped
Seeing stars turned inside out, we thought our minds had flipped
Colors swirling, sounds are drifting, thinking we were dead
The wizard turned and spoke to us and, this is what he said

Through the virgin universe, upon his back we played
Creating and destroying with the music we made
Undulate the cosmic rhythm, galaxies were born
Clouds of blue, fluorescent dunes, spreading out before
Yeah"

Condemned to die before I could breathe
Millions are screaming, the dead are still living

I don't care, this world means nothing
Life has no meaning, my feelings are numb

Sacrificed for the glory of one

Dead fill the streets up to the sky
Tears fill my eyes but I will not die

Black seas spew up Leviathan, even new gods are stillborn
When the earth finally crashes into the sun
Tears of joy at last as I burn

This dying world gasps its last breath
As we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die
Die!

I need something to fix the pain
Baby, baby, please stick the needle in
Then I'll be dead and blue
Just like you

This dying world gasps its last breath
As we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die
Die!

[Solo]

Hellhounds still haunting me
I know I'll never be free
Lucifer, my only friend
I'll burn in Hell 'til the end, yeah!

I'm so dead inside
Wishing I could die
Your torture and screams
Still haunt my dreams

This dying world gasps its last breath
As we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die
Die!

This world has made me depraved and sick
Yeah, baby, I tortured you just for kicks
But I am obsessed by evil
Forever a servant of the Devil"

50,Come My Fanatics....,Son of Nothing,"[Verse 1]
Dying sun fades in our sky
The time has come for us to say goodbye
Construct the pods, we must evacuate
To the stars again, is this to be our fate?

[Hook]
Oh baby, just maybe, we'll take you
To the sun of nothingness

We left the war pigs far behind

Will we ever reach our journey's end
To find a world and start again

51,Electric Wizard,Stone Magnet,"Drawn by the power of the ultraviolet sun
Spinning eye of the Lord, it looks upon
Magnetic cobs spread forth and spin a web
I can see a thousand worlds right here in my bed

Looking all around, the world's a dream
Traveling to places that I have never seen
High up here is where I'm really free
Listen people, you've got to free the weed

You knew I would make you feel
But look around you, what you got
No hope, no future, no fuckin' job

52,We Live,Sun Has Turned to Black,"Earth torn from it's path by meteoric pass
Showered by debris
Continents crumble, our cities funeral pyres

We cannot escape
Everlasting night, return to pagan rites
The old ones rule supreme"

Supercoven

Have awakened the ancient ones
Mindless slaves to the black god
Moan dark hymns to the sun
They watch from the sun
Since our lives had begun
They want us to be free
If only we could see
Yeah! Turn to the sun

SUPERCOVEN! (repeat until you are stoned)"
54,Witchcult Today,The Chosen Few,"Hail covens this is it
A 1000 amps toll the end time riff
The sky a coffin lid
All condemned beneath its shadow
The chosen few, the chosen knew
Spelled out in the stars his prophecy
Raise your fists now you exist
The bell of doom strikes 13th hour

The time has come
All the chosen time to put down your bongs
Take up a knife end all life
Legalise drugs and murder
Satanas luciferus we pledge these souls to you
Now satans slaves, your lives weren't saved
Die now in the shadow of the pentagram

The chosen few, look up in the sky
The chosen few, waiting for the sign
The chosen few, still children of the grave
Satan's slaves"

Are you a Nightchild? Join us and be free

Your rotten world means nothing to me
Undercover of darkness is when I am free
The Nightchild is creeping, forever seeking
New bodies new victims, drug and murder addicted

I am the Nightchild, shadows gather round me
Are you a Nightchild? Join us and be free

I am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild
I am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild
I am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild

A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold - my hate begins to breed

Black nebula, seething in my brain
Then your fucking world brings me down again
So I'll take my fathers gun and I walk down to the street
I'll have my vengeance now with everyone I meet, yeah!

A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold - my hate begins to breed

Cause i hate that you breathe
I see you duck
You little punk

Brass knuckles in the back of the car
Cause we drunk drive cadillacs- we never go far
And when you see us motherfuckers
Better know who we are

I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
Motherfuckers who don't know what
You better watch what you say
From these industry fucks
To these faggot ass punks
You don't know what it takes
To get this motherfucking truck

And all the fags who bad mouth this music
It's fuckin stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
You cowards can't, never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, i played the pill, i nearly died for this music

You make me wanna run around, pulling my guns out and shit
Your tempting me to run my mouth, and call you out on this bitch
I heard the reason you got to beater to believe any of this
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge

What? you can't see the sarcasm in the verses i spit?
What? you think i just got lucky and didn't work for this shit?
Bitch. i've been working at this ever since i was a kid
I played a million empty shows to only family and friends

What kind of person gets disembanded and deserves to get big?
I hate to be that person when my verse comes out of the kid's lips
That shits as worse as it gets
This verse is over, i quit

We are breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom
Pack of wolves

Because its nothing in my mouth except my dick and what i spit
So my dick is in my hand when i respond to faggots talking shit
Speaking of fags, already wrap with the drag
We killed him and then we stuffed his body in the cadillac

Why you always pressin?
You know i'm never stressing
With fucking dms

Got phantom and the rest
Who are down there at the west
A grew up by drive-by's and l.a gangsta's

So what the fuck do you know about being a gangsta?
What the fuck do you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this, so you know you're just talking shit

Inside her coffin
She spreads her wings

Her wicked caresses

And obscene kisses

Her serpent body writhes
Dead eyes now open wide
My senses numbed by vices
Submerging in her darkness

Her wicked caresses
And obscene kisses
Her wicked caresses
And obscene kisses

Her icy touch enslaves my soul
I need her evil but she's so cold

Your cold, so evil
I'm lost, I need you

They light black candles
A chant begins
Inside her coffin
She spreads her wings

Her wicked caresses
And obscene kisses

Upon it stands the astral mind
The burning chaosphere seethes behind
Ours to see yet we are blind

And the eyes of Man look on and beyond
I am a god, I am the one
Into the chaos see my time has begun

The chosen are ready, destiny realigns
Eye of ultra soul, together we join
Alone again, once again, into the void

Freedom rays awaken the chosen ones

75,Electric Wizard,Wooden Pipe,"One day we were sitting and wondering where it's at
When down came a dragon with a wizard on his back
He said to us, step up, wanna take you for a trip
Then up we flew off into space and the astral gates we slipped
Alright

Looking back behind us, to the freaks and heads we wave
And off beyond our system out until they're deep in space
And on the edge of time and space there stood two towers black
But on we flew, the wizard knew there was no turning back
Cast your spell on me

Higher and higher, through the cosmos we had tripped
Seeing stars turned inside out, we thought our minds had flipped
Colors swirling, sounds are drifting, thinking we were dead
The wizard turned and spoke to us and, this is what he said

Through the virgin universe, upon his back we played
Creating and destroying with the music we made
Undulate the cosmic rhythm, galaxies were born
Clouds of blue, fluorescent dunes, spreading out before
Yeah"
